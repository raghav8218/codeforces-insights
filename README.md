- **Grouped verdicts:**
  - Correct
  - Wrong Answer (only first attempt per problem)
  - Time Limit Exceeded
  - Other verdicts (Compilation Error, Skipped, etc.)
- **Sort problems** by difficulty rating (ascending/descending)
- **Submission timestamps** for each problem.
- **Clickable links** to each problem on Codeforces.
